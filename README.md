Mora
=========

`mora` is a proof of concept command line interface for basic PDF generation. 

A quick warning: it currently does basically nothing. 

Installation
------------

```sh
pip install pyinstaller
yes | pyinstaller mora.py
```

Quickstart
----------

You'll need a file `*.mora` which contains `mora` compatible contents. Right now, It basically can only support a single line of text. Hopefully we support more soon!

To use:
```
mora text.mora
```

It's that simple!
